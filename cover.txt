Dear Hiring Manager,

I graduated from The Iron Yard's Backend Engineering course in April and have been programming ever since. I'm presently working on an RoR application with a startup in Durham, and I was working with a proprietary IDE for a law group immediately before.

I became a programmer after a decade of writing and editing for some very large, visible companies in America and North Carolina (such as Michelin, Syngenta and the North Carolina Lottery). My attention to detail and communication skills are superior, and I thrive in collaborative team environments.

Though I have focused on Ruby, programming is about how you think rather than what syntax you're using. I have a little experience with Java, but my programming skills are such that I feel I can pick up what I need to in this position.

I feel that my skills and experience are a great fit for this position. Please feel free to contact me to arrange an interview. I look forward to learning more about this opportunity.
